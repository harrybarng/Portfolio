                                        University of Washington facebook pages were used to distribute surveys and   
                                        student volunteers were contacted to conduct interviews.
                                        While addiction may sound like a negative influence, in this case, addiction 
                                        encourages more practices and longer learning times through the website.  
                                        Majority of participants claimed less distraction and interactivity helps with the

                                    experience and website navigation. Thus, we decided to design for desktop first and create an adaptive website.

                                <br><br>Although, redesigning the whole website (including occasional animations) did result in some rushed UI and unfinished implementations, 
                                I learned the importance of working with developers and user research/ testing, developed a better sense of HTML layouts and design 
                                critics and defense argument skills. Gamification was not a concept I was familiar with when I first started the project. During the project
                                Bob helped me define a clear logic of gamification and develop a suitable gamified design appropriate for the college course setting.

                                Thanks again to my team for providing valuable feedbacks and critics throughout the project and to the participants who given me 
                                new problems that lead to more refined version 1.
